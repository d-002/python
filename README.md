Random small python projects I made

---

## Projects here (chronological order)

- ### Obstacles (05/2020)  
  First game I made, about a stickman in an autoscroller jumping and avoiding spikes

- ### Snake (06/2020)  
  First `pygame` game. Snake clone, way too slow and becomes way too hard.

- ### Pong (07/2020)  
  Pong game, uses Multiponk's music (not sure about copyright). Powerups and stuff. Pretty cool game looking back, but the code is very messy.

- ### Jonglage (07/2020)  
  Juggling simulator, easily customizable.

- ### Snakes (11/2020)  
  An attempt at recreating [snake.io](https://snake.io)

- ### Tic Tac Toe (02/2021)  
  Tic tac toe with 3 different AIs, including an unbeatable one. The latter crashes the game if it loses. The combinations are hard-coded, I remember doing so because I watched a video, intended for a human audience, about tic tac toe strategies, that I built upon to come up with the final algorithm.

- ### Rock-paper-scissors (03/2021)  
  Rock-paper-scissors game with a basic AI. Tries to recognize basic patterns and uses known human strategies.

- ### Nyan cat (01/2021)  
  Nyan cat.

- ### Game of life (06/2021)
  Conway's Game of life

- ### Cookie clicker (09/2021)
  Abandoned yet somewhat finished cookie clicker clone

- ### Python server (12/2021)
  Transmission service through FTP. Transfer files, send messages, get webpages. I made this while I didn't have an internet connection, and had to hijack the `server.py` file in a Raspberry Pi to get information.

- ### Console tetris (12/2021)
  Console Tetris. Looks good using the `colorama` module.

- ### Surf (12/2021)
  Basic console web browser, used to read and format webpages in a Raspberry Pi. Can be used with *Python server*

- ## Utilities (created in 12/2021)
  Different Python utilities. Get Minecraft skin head, check if internet connection, extract Minecraft assets, get icon by extension...

- ### Rubik's Cube timer (12/2021)
  Timer for Rubik's Cube. Mean, ao5, ao12 and more. Saved scramble and my personal times are here ~~because I was too lazy to remove them~~ as a bonus I guess

- ### Fr√©quence 3 (01/2022)
  Webradio player, with PewDiePie waves in the background for big CPU usage

- ### Macro (02/2022)
  Overengineered and unfinished Scratch-like macro editor
  
- ### Impossible to close (02/2022)
  Window designed to be impossible to close. Warning: can get out of hand for version 2. Abandoned project

- ### Tetris AI (v1) (02/2022)
  Strange classic tetris-like Tetris AI. Got to 559 lines once.

- ### Wordle (04/2022)
  Wordle clone but I think it's missing some words

- ### Chess (05/2022)
  Chess game with a relatively bad AI

- ### Visual keyboard (Tetris) (06/2022)
  Visual keyboard for playing tetris and displaying the pressed keys

- ### Zombs royale de wish (09/2022)
  Clone of a .io game, but better with GOD AI (look for nametag Dream)

- ### CPS test (10/2022)
  Simple CPS test (I was bored in class)

- ### Wallpaper (01/2023)
  Simple, random idea, makes wallpapers.

- ### Dinosaur (05/2023)
  Chrome Dino game bot. Very smart, can also flex.

- ### Tetris AI (v2) (09/2023)
  Way better tetris ai than *v1*, modern tetris-like, looks like jstris.

- ### Tictactoe2 (11/2023)
  Game and unbeatable AI for a variant of Tic Tac Toe where you only place 3 pawns and move them following rules. My first time implementing minimax.

- ### Minesweeper (12/2023)
  Simple classic Minesweeper
