- ### Pong (07/2020)  
  Pong game, uses Multiponk's music (not sure about copyright). Powerups and stuff. Pretty cool game looking back, but the code is very messy.

- ### Tic Tac Toe (02/2021)  
  Tic tac toe with 3 different AIs, including an unbeatable one. The latter crashes the game if it loses. The combinations are hard-coded, I remember doing so because I watched a video, intended for a human audience, about tic tac toe strategies, that I built upon to come up with the final algorithm. I made the music and I really quite like it.
